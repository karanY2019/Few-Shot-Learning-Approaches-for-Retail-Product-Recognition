# Few-Shot-Learning-Approaches-for-Retail-Product-Recognition
This is the final project for the Deep Learning class. It is using few shot learning for inventory management in retail scenarios

In this paper, we test the performance and fit of Prototypical Networks (ProtoNet),
a low-shot image classification method proposed by Snell et al. [8] to a real world
fine-grain dataset of grocery store products. We evaluated the performance of
ProtoNet with different hyper parameters, embedders, and augmentation methods
on the fine-grained Caltech-UCSD Birds Dataset (CUB) [11], a Grocery Store
Dataset proposed by Klasson, et al. [4], as well as a combination of the two datasets.
We found that Prototypical Networks combined with pre-trained ResNets and stateof-art auto augmentation techniques a promising approach to tackle few-shot image
classification problems in the retail domain
